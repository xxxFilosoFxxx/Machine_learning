# Examples of machine learning work in python
### Using numpy and scikit-learn

- In [this file](https://github.com/xxxFilosoFxxx/Machine_learning_with_scikit-learn/blob/master/linearRegression_Gradient_SGA.ipynb) uses linear regression, gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In addition, a comparison with the scikit-learn library and measurements of the operation time of functions is indicated.
