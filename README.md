# Examples of machine learning work in python
### Using numpy and scikit-learn

- In [this file](https://github.com/xxxFilosoFxxx/Machine_learning/blob/master/linearRegression_Gradient_SGD.ipynb) uses linear regression, gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In addition, a comparison with the scikit-learn library and measurements of the operation time of functions is indicated.
- In [this file](https://github.com/xxxFilosoFxxx/Machine_learning/blob/master/polynomial_regression_without_sk.ipynb) uses stochastic descent polynomial regression. Comparison with scikit-learn is shown, function run times are measured, and learning curve graphs are shown.
- In [this file](https://github.com/xxxFilosoFxxx/Machine_learning/blob/master/logistic_regression_with_sklearn.ipynb) used a logistic regression function with a generated dataset of values from 0 to 3. Otherwise, this problem can be solved using the sigmoidal function and the numpay library.

### Using PyTorch

- In [this file](https://github.com/xxxFilosoFxxx/Machine_learning/blob/master/GAN/GAN_height_and_weight.ipynb) a generative-adversarial network was used using the example of height-weight data. The pandas library was used and the data normalized.
