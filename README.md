# Examples of machine learning work in python
### Using numpy and scikit-learn

- In [this file](https://github.com/xxxFilosoFxxx/Machine_learning_with_scikit-learn/blob/master/linearRegression_Gradient_SGD.ipynb) uses linear regression, gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In addition, a comparison with the scikit-learn library and measurements of the operation time of functions is indicated.
- In [this file](https://github.com/xxxFilosoFxxx/Machine_learning_with_scikit-learn/blob/master/polynomial_regression_without_sk.ipynb) uses stochastic descent polynomial regression. Comparison with scikit-learn is shown, function run times are measured, and learning curve graphs are shown.
